This is my personal blog built with Hugo and using the LoveIt theme. The "blog" branch in the project stores the source code, which is automatically read and executed with the hugo command using GitHub Actions technology to generate static pages stored in the "main" branch, and deployed with GitHub Pages. The blog's URL is: https://cloud1998.github.io/.
